# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Car Dekho Dataset

## Overview![Screenshot 2024-03-14 000152](https://github.com/0bushra/EDA-cars/assets/103776716/e22ea62a-6be2-4ac3-840c-7951afbf22d4)


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in understanding and analyzing any dataset. It involves exploring the data, summarizing its main characteristics, and visualizing its features to gain insights and identify patterns.

In this project, we perform EDA on the 'Car Dekho' dataset, which contains information about various cars including their selling price, year of manufacture, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission type, and owner count.

## EDA Process

The EDA process typically involves the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Check for missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data. Handle them appropriately to ensure the data's integrity and reliability.

2. **Descriptive Statistics**: Compute summary statistics such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc., to understand the central tendency, spread, and shape of the data distribution.

3. **Univariate Analysis**: Analyze each variable individually to understand its distribution and characteristics. This may involve plotting histograms, box plots, bar plots, etc., for numerical and categorical variables.

4. **Bivariate Analysis**: Explore relationships between pairs of variables to uncover any correlations or associations. This can be done using scatter plots, correlation matrices, pair plots, etc.

5. **Visualization**: Use various visualization techniques such as scatter plots, bar charts, heatmaps, etc., to present the findings of the analysis in an intuitive and informative manner.

6. **Insights and Recommendations**: Summarize key findings, insights, and recommendations based on the EDA results. This could include identifying important features affecting the selling price of cars, understanding market trends, or predicting future demand.


## Usage

To perform EDA on the Car Dekho dataset:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and open the Jupyter notebooks.
3. Follow the code and instructions in the notebooks to execute the EDA process step by step.
4. Refer to the visualizations and insights generated to better understand the dataset and draw conclusions.
